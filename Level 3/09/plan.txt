1) Create console app - Java HTML Temlate Engine - jHTE
2) Class Renderer creates Reader and Parser. Main class creates Renderer and render "home" view. Renderer returns <h2>Hello</h2>
3) BAD - Renderer has high coupling with Reader and Parser. If they require constructor parameters, Renderer need to know about it.

4) IoC - Instead of creating them itself Renderer will require them in the constructor;
5) Now we should provide all dependencies when we create Renderer.
6) We may use IoC container
7) Add Spring dependencies and context
8) Refactor with autowired
