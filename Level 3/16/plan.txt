1) Describe the disadvantages of the current architecture
2) Introduce Hiberbate (show site and doc)

3) Add a SessionFactory dependency into the PostRepository - try to find Dependency with IDEA and add to POM automatically

4) Add a persistent config to configure Hibernate

5) Add annotations to entities to let them be a model to Hibernate (create the DB objects)

6) Strange bug in IDEA - gone when add spring-orm (to POM )

7) The result of all changes: everything starts without any post, DB is created and filled with DB object. If Db is filled in MySQL Workbench, we may see the real post data


COMMIT

10) Set up AppConfig and start the application

COMMIT

11) The problem - many repositories and many HSQL strings
