1) create resources dir, add site.css, add simple class with back color
2) link this file with HTML page and look at it in the browser
3) create js/site.js file with alert('Hi') and link it with the page
4) reload page to see how it works

Why HTML, CSS and JS? The original idea was to divide markup, appearance and behaviour.

5) As a CSS framewrok we will use bootstrap - http://getbootstrap.com/

8) start it - the appearance has changed
9) We need to place everything to the container DIV
